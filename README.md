# COVID-19 Contact-Tracing Apps Tracker

Tracing apps are proliferating; this repo is trying to keep track of them, with an eye on privacy implications.

## Contact-Tracing App Projects

* #### [CoEpi](https://www.coepi.org) | Community Epidemiology In Action

	**Status**: In development

	**Technical synopsis**

	The CoEpi app uses Bluetooth to record an anonymized list of close-proximity Interactions with other users.

	* In an Interaction, apps exchange temporary Contact-Event-Numbers (CEN). The other user's CEN is stored along with a timestamp for when the interaction occurred. Temporary CENs are deterministically generated from a cryptographic Key, which is private by default.
	* User can choose to upload their Key, along with symptoms, to a public database
	* The app downloads Keys and their associated Symptoms from the public database and searches local Interactions records to determine if any of the User's interactions were with symptomatic users
	* No location data is captured

* #### [TraceTogether](https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/) (Singapore)

	> By using time-varying tokens, the app does keep
	the users private from each other. A user has no
	way of knowing who the tokens stored in their app
	belong to, except by linking them to the time the
	token was received. However, the app provides
	little to no privacy for infected individuals; after
	an infected individual is compelled to release their
	data, the Singaporean government can build a list
	of all the other people they have been in contact
	with.

* #### [Private Kit: Safe Paths](http://safepaths.mit.edu/)

	**Status**: Apps are live, backends and agency integrations in development

	**Technical synopsis**

	The Safe Paths app saves the user's GPS location data to a local encrypted store.

	* When a user tests positive, they can choose to give their location records to a health professional, who then manually redacts personally-identifiable information and publishes the redacted data to a public database.
	* The app downloads location data of infected cases from the public database to search against locally-stored location history

## Are you developing a Tracing App?

Please PR an overview of your system into this repo!

## Threat scenarios

* The One-Interaction-User scenario
	* Sequence
		1. Over the course of two weeks, User A only comes near one other user, User B
		2. User B tests positive and uploads case data
		3. User A receives a notification that they've been exposed
		4. User A knows that User B is infected

## Meta

We're pondering the clearest way to present the above information, and how to aggregate and present community concerns and discussion about the individual projects.
